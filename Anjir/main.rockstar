You said Happy New Year! and all but
your promise is a fake deceptive lie
my heart's broken into pieces yet you
knock my heart down, down, down

embarrassment's himself flirtin'
My ex's a charlatanic cauliflower
the news is everyone balked
man's fucked everybody

Cast embarrassment into nothingness
Scream it
Burn my ex into ashes
Scream it

Cast the news into fire
Scream it
Burn man into cinders
Shout it

shout "on!"
