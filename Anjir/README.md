## Piet

Decode the image using base64, then use your favourite Piet Interpreter!

This part piece depicts my new years resolutions to keep smiling amidst the pandemic and gloomy days past (the dark blue behind Pepe's head) and to look ahead to the bright future (light blue). Despite the obvious pain that pepe is in (he is crying), he is smiling even with his imperfections, which is symbolised by the use of a green frog and his yellow teeth. On a side note, this is also another new years resolution - to always maintain my health and hygiene. The top left are nice, light colors which often forms colors of a friendship band, gently affirming that I do have people around me who supports me and cares about me. On the right, you can see in pixelated form: LIVE LAUGH [HEART EMOJI], which symbolizes the positive attitude of people oft seen in movies who are enjoying their lives. The output of the code, which is a singular letter 'F', is a reference to the first-person shooter Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which goes "Press 'F' to pay respects', constantly reminding myself to always be grateful towards what what have happened in the past.

## Brainfuck

run it through your favourite interpreter :)

This one is pretty simple, it shows my feet on a scale which paints my new years resolution to lose weight! (No I'm not 200kg+ it's in chinese jin so divide by 2 thanks)

## Cow

no input required - go to your favourite intepreter :) https://tio.run/#cow is pretty nice

This one is a smiley blob (that's me, quite fat) with a graduation cap! the new years resolution is to maintain enough score to actually graduate well :D

## Ook

You can use your favourite Ook interpreter! I personally transpiled it to BF since it's an easy substitution and ran a BF interpreter, since I couldn't find a legit ook interpreter online (some offline one but I'm stuck on Windows for a while so a bit of a hassle). 

Different drawing than my BF submission, but the same one as my COW (since those has different instruction set)

## Rockstar

https://codewithrockstar.com/online no input needed

Can neither confirm nor deny that man's heartbroken and his new year resolution is to move on :) taken a more liberal definition of 'draw' here as to paint my pain and catharsis in poem form (with the code output itself actually making a message too)
